LM editor controls and usage:


ART MODE - 
	When drawing on a tile drawing zone, select the tile you want from the album and then click to draw
	Use right click to erase the tile 
	If you want to copy a section to the workpad, ctrl-click the top left, then the bottom right
	Use alt to paste the current workpad into the active layer
	To draw, you need to select a sublayer (click in the menu, will highlight in red). Lower on the list = in front
	The prime layer (determines size of room,  essentially the main layer) has blue text. 

COLLISION MODE - 
	Basically the same as art mode
	Tiles are half the size though so careful how you draw
